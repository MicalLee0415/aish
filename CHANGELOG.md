## [0.3.4] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- Added multimodal image support so user messages can attach local image files and send them as structured content blocks to compatible models.
- Added an interactive `/feedback` command that collects system context, redacts sensitive log lines, and opens a pre-filled GitHub issue in the browser.
- Added `/help` with topic-based help pages and markdown rendering, plus `/quit` as an exit alias for the interactive shell.
- Added a `web_fetch` tool so the agent can retrieve and summarize web page content during a session.
- Added ESC handling in readline to cancel the current input line without leaving the shell.

### Changed

- Changed the feedback issue template to include bug-report sections such as steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior.
- Changed the project license metadata from MIT to Apache-2.0 so packaging files match the shipped `LICENSE`.

### Fixed

- Fixed confirmation panel rendering so the right border draws correctly in the terminal UI.
- Fixed feedback log attachment so oversized bodies keep as many recent log lines as possible instead of dropping logs entirely when the GitHub issue URL would exceed the length limit.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Fixed tab completion regression where multiple candidates sharing a prefix would fail to auto-complete, the screen could blank with stale PTY echo state, or stale completions would still be reported when only one match remained. The PTY layer now drains stale control-pipe events before issuing a `__aish_complete` query, `CommandState::take_submission` no longer lets a `PromptReady{command_seq:None}` event steal a backend submission registered with a seq, and bash's `_aish_resolve_compreply` no longer prepends a spurious `./` to bare filename completions.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- Added a slash-command suggestion popup and a built-in `/feedback` command so interactive command discovery is faster inside the shell.
- Added ESC interrupt handling, richer keyboard events, and improved inline dialogs and panels for interactive shell flows.

### Changed

- Changed `ask_user` interactions to use the new dialog flow with clearer validation, cancel handling, and localized prompt copy.

### Fixed

- Fixed PTY cleanup on shell shutdown so background terminal resources are released more reliably.
- Fixed prompt cwd refresh after `ai bash` changes directory so the shell prompt stays in sync.
- Fixed `ask_user` default matching and validation reporting so trimmed defaults and structured errors behave consistently.
- Fixed slash popup anchoring so the menu stays attached to the active prompt line.


## [0.3.2] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- Added official PyPI packaging for stable Linux amd64 and arm64 releases, including a packaged `aish` launcher that installs via `pip`.
- Added release workflow steps to build, smoke test, and publish PyPI artifacts alongside the existing bundle release assets.

### Changed

- Changed self-update and uninstall flows to detect pip-based installations and preserve the original install channel details when upgrading.

### Fixed

- Fixed release CI follow-up issues around formatting, lint gates, and the sandbox worker test so the new PyPI release path can pass the full validation pipeline reliably.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-29

### Fixed

- Fixed competing stdin readers around `ask_user` and related interactive flows so prompts no longer fight with shell input watchers.
- Fixed UTF-8 slicing bugs that could panic on non-ASCII paths or truncated error bodies during setup and prompt rendering.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-26

### Added

- Added nested SSH session detection with stronger interrupt handling so remote interactive sessions can be identified and interrupted more reliably.
- Added a host dossier pipeline and the `host_note` AI tool so per-host notes and profile data can persist across sessions.

### Changed

- Changed the Rust PTY and secure-bash flow to better support nested remote session execution and follow-up tool work.

### Fixed

- Fixed `host_note` persistence so profile-save failures are surfaced instead of being reported as success.
- Fixed Rust CI and clippy regressions introduced by the SSH and host-dossier changes.

## [0.3.0-beta.3] - 2026-05-13

### Added

- Added nested SSH session detection with stronger interrupt handling so remote interactive sessions can be identified and interrupted more reliably.
- Added a host dossier pipeline and the `host_note` AI tool so per-host notes and profile data can persist across sessions.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added

- Added `aish models usage` so the CLI can show the current model, resolved provider, credential source or auth state, and provider dashboard entry.
- Added `prompt_theme` configuration for reusable shell prompt styles on top of the existing prompt scripting support.
- Added opt-in live smoke coverage for real provider credentials and installed bundle verification before release.

### Changed

- Changed the shell architecture from the old `shell.py` plus `shell_enhanced` and `tui` helpers into dedicated `shell/runtime`, `shell/ui`, `shell/pty`, shared `pty`, and `interaction` modules.
- Changed the interactive shell flow to use explicit backend control events and editing phases, improving multiline input, completions, confirmation panels, ask_user dialogs, and recovery after long-running terminal sessions.
- Changed model auth entry so `aish models auth` is the primary command path, while the old `login` path remains as a compatibility alias.

### Removed

- Removed the unfinished plan, research, think, and old TUI-oriented code paths from the active shell implementation.

### Fixed

- Fixed Ctrl+C handling for AI operations and interactive PTY sessions so control returns to the shell more predictably after interruptions.
- Fixed false error hints for normal SIGPIPE-based pager exits such as quitting `less`.
- Fixed packaged bundle startup by including the bash wrapper assets required by the PTY shell.

### Security

- Fixed a history command injection vulnerability in the shell execution path.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- Added shell prompt scripting support with built-in templates, examples, and hot reload so prompts can be customized without modifying core code.
- Added full localized interface coverage for German, Spanish, French, Japanese, and Chinese alongside the existing English experience.

### Changed

- Changed the setup wizard to better guide provider configuration with clearer loading feedback during key assignment and verification.
- Changed assistant response rendering to use a more compact message box layout for long replies in the terminal UI.

### Fixed

- Fixed transient OpenAI Codex request failures by retrying temporary upstream errors during provider requests.
- Fixed sandbox startup and IPC routing so sandboxed execution remains reliable in both normal and frozen binary environments.
- Fixed missing localized labels for sandbox approval actions in non-English interfaces.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- Added a provider abstraction layer for OAuth-backed integrations, including a reusable provider registry and shared OAuth helpers.
- Added regression coverage for release metadata extraction so tagged releases read notes from the versioned changelog section.

### Changed

- Changed the release pipeline to be fully tag-driven by removing the manual Release PR workflow and creating GitHub Releases directly from stable tag pushes.
- Changed OpenAI Codex provider internals to use the shared provider/OAuth architecture for future provider expansion.

### Fixed

- Fixed LiteLLM provider tool calls so forwarded tool parameters reach the provider correctly.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- Added built-in OpenAI Codex OAuth support.
- Added a unified Release Preparation workflow that validates the target version and dry-runs release bundles before the final release.
- Added tag-driven GitHub Release publishing for stable `vX.Y.Z` pushes.

### Changed

- Changed the release pipeline to publish Linux binary bundles for amd64 and arm64 from stable git tags, with install and smoke-test verification in CI.
- Changed release metadata handling so version normalization, versioned changelog extraction, and previous-tag discovery are generated consistently for release workflows.

### Removed

- Removed Debian package publishing from the release path; new releases should be installed from the published binary bundle instead of a .deb package.

### Fixed

- Fixed bundle install and uninstall scripts so packaged binaries, services, and install layout are handled consistently.
- Fixed Linux bundle smoke tests to match the installer layout used by release artifacts.
- Fixed startup welcome screen rendering regressions.
- Fixed official website redirection failures.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-12-29

### Added

- Initial public project structure.

### Changed

- Established the first project release and Debian packaging baseline.
